<h4 id="can-i-convert-subscriptions-founds-to-total-charge">Can I convert subscriptions founds to total charge</h4>

<p>One-time charges and subscriptions founds are separated. However, depending on application policy, you can ask the developer to credit your total charge.</p>



<h2 id="developer">Developer</h2>



<h4 id="why-would-i-use-monetizejs">Why would I use MonetizeJS?</h4>

<p>Because:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are developing a pure client side application, so you don’t have any server,</li>
<li>Or you have web services but you don’t want to manage users and payment transactions on your server.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?</h4>

<p>MonetizeJS applies a <strong>5%</strong> fee on top of the Stripe fee, 2.4% + 24c + VAT per successful charge (see <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">https://stripe.com/pricing</a>).</p>
