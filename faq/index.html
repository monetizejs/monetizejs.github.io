<p><strong>What’s the purpose of MonetizeJS?</strong></p>

<p>MonetizeJS provides user payment services for applications that aren’t tied to any server or that don’t want to implement user management.</p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>

<p>As a seller, MonetizeJS applies a <strong>5%</strong> fee on top of Stripe’s processing fees. MonetizeJS doesn’t charge a fee to use the service as a buyer, but fees may be charged by your bank in connection with the debiting of your card.</p>

<p><strong>How do I cancel a subscription?</strong></p>

<p>To cancel a subscription, go to “My apps”, select the application and click “Unsubscribe”. The subscription will remain active until the end of the billing period, at which point it won’t be renewed.</p>

<p><strong>How can I perform payments using MonetizeJS?</strong></p>

<p>Payments are performed via redirections to the MonetizeJS platform. You have 3 ways to perform the redirection:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <strong>monetize.js client-side library</strong>, you can redirect the user from your application (full-page redirection or pop-up) using simple JavaScript calls.</li>
<li>Using the <strong>OAuth2 flow</strong>, you can redirect the user to the <code>authorize</code> endpoint.</li>
<li>Using the <strong>MonetizeJS button</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can I check payments from my application?</strong></p>

<p>Payments can be verified from your application by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <strong>monetize.js client-side library</strong>, you can validate payments in a pure client-side application.</li>
<li>Using the <strong>REST API</strong>, you can validate payments from a client-side application or from your server, using an access token retrieved from the monetize.js client-side library or the OAuth2 flow.</li>
<li>Using the <strong>CouchDB API</strong>, you can check a particular user’s payments from your server.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are the requirements for my application to use MonetizeJS?</strong></p>

<p>MonetizeJS platform requires an HTML5 compatible environment to handle redirections, including modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE9+, Safari…), hybrid mobile applications, HTML5 based desktop applications…</p>

<p><strong>How are users impacted by pricing option modifications?</strong></p>

<p>When a developer modifies a pricing option, users that have already paid are not impacted, which means:</p>

<ul>
<li>current one-off charge is evaluated at its original price.</li>
<li>current subscription will continue to be charged at its original rate.</li>
</ul>
