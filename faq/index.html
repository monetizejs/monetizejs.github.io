<p>Because:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are developing a pure client side application, so you don’t have any server,</li>
<li>Or you have web services but you don’t want to manage users and payment transactions on your server.</li>
</ul>

<p>MonetizeJS applies a <strong>5%</strong> fee on top of the Stripe fee, 2.4% + 24c + VAT per successful charge (see <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">https://stripe.com/pricing</a>).</p>
