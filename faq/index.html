<p><strong>Can I convert subscription funds to one-time charge funds?</strong></p>

<p>One-time charges and subscriptions founds are separated. However, depending on application policy, you can ask the developer to credit your one-time charge funds.</p>

<p><strong>Why would I use MonetizeJS in my application?</strong></p>

<p>Because:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are developing a pure client side application, so you don’t have any server,</li>
<li>Or you have web services but you don’t want to manage users and payment transactions on your server.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>

<p>MonetizeJS applies a <strong>5%</strong> fee on top of the Stripe fees (2.4% + 24c + VAT per successful charge, for more information: <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">https://stripe.com/pricing</a>).</p>
